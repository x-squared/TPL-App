# Editable Field Labeling

When asked to introduce a label for an editable field, follow this order:

1. **Preferred**: indicate the label inside the field (placeholder / inline control label) when the control type supports it and usability is not harmed.
2. **If inline is not feasible** (common for date-like value fields): add a **very small, subtle label directly above that specific field**.

Rules for the fallback micro-label:

- Keep the form row on one line unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Anchor the label to the target field container so it appears above that field (not at far left/right of the whole row).
- Use small helper-text styling (low visual weight, e.g. around `0.62rem`, muted color).
- Do not introduce large section labels or extra vertical spacing.

Example intent:
- `Renewal` above renewal date input, while all capture inputs remain on the same line.
