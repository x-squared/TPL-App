# Manual Maintenance Rule

After implementing changes, always evaluate whether any manual in `doc/` should be updated.

- **Update manuals when reasonably indicated**:
  - Behavior, workflows, commands, environment setup, test flow, reporting flow, or architecture usage changed.
  - New feature requires user/developer instructions to use correctly.
  - Existing manual content would become misleading without an update.
  - External interface architecture, integration flows, adapter/client conventions, or interface operations changed.

- **Do not force manual edits when likely unrelated**:
  - If a change clearly does not affect documented topics, skip manual edits.
  - Judge relevance using manual titles and scope (for example: setup, server, client, seeding, specification, test).

- **When updating manuals**:
  - Keep updates concise and consistent with existing wording.
  - Prefer editing the most relevant manual(s) over duplicating text across many manuals.
  - Add cross-links when a change spans multiple manuals.
  - Manuals in `doc/` must use `.qmd` (Quarto) format; do not introduce new `*-manual.md` files.
  - Command/code blocks intended for execution should use runnable Quarto chunks (for example ` ```{bash} `) instead of plain fenced code blocks.
  - For external interface changes, `doc/interface-manual.qmd` is the primary manual and must be checked first.
  - If interface changes alter runtime/env/operator behavior, also update `doc/server-manual.qmd`.

- **Before finishing**:
  - State briefly whether manuals were updated or intentionally left unchanged, and why.
