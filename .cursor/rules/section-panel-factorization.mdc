# Section Panel Factorization

Use sections as the primary demarcation line in complex view components.

- **Default principle**: Each substantial `<section>` block should live in its own component file.
- **Thin tab/container**: Tab components coordinate state, routing, and callbacks; they should not inline multiple full panel implementations.
- **Panel cohesion**: Keep each extracted section focused on one concern (for example basic data, donor data, hospitals, protocol overview, time log).
- **Typed panel contracts**: Define explicit props for each panel; avoid wide, untyped prop spreading.
- **Behavior safety**: Refactoring into panels must preserve existing UX/logic unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- **Escalation trigger**: If a tab/component starts holding several independent sections, extract panels before adding more features.

This rule applies proactively to new view work and to refactors of oversized existing tabs.
