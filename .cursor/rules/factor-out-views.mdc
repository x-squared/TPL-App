# Factor Out Views

When creating or modifying a page-level view (e.g. Patients, Items), always place it in its own file under `frontend/src/views/`, with a co-located CSS file.

- Each view is a self-contained component with its own state, data fetching, and event handlers.
- The view file exports a default function component (e.g. `PatientsView`).
- Each view has its own CSS file (e.g. `PatientsView.css`) imported by the component. Only styles specific to that view belong there.
- `App.tsx` only imports and renders views; it does not contain view-specific logic.
- `App.css` only contains global, layout, and shared styles (login, sidebar, main-content, data-table, etc.).
- Shared utilities (e.g. `formatDate`, `matchesFilter`) may live in the view file or be extracted to a shared utils module if reused across views.

```
frontend/src/views/
  PatientsView.tsx
  PatientsView.css
  ItemsView.tsx
  ItemsView.css
```

```tsx
// App.tsx – render views by page
{page === 'patients' && <PatientsView />}
{page === 'items' && <ItemsView />}
```
