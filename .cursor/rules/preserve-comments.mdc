# Preserve Existing Comments

When editing files, **never remove, modify, or relocate existing comments** unless the user explicitly asks you to.

This includes:
- Module-level / file-level docstrings and comment blocks
- Inline comments
- Section separators or TODO/FIXME markers

If a comment becomes outdated due to your changes, flag it to the user instead of silently removing it.
