# Medical Value Universe

- Keep medical value templates and runtime values context-aware (`STATIC`, `EPISODE:*`, `DONOR`) with explicit context metadata persisted on rows.
- Treat patient blood type as a medical value concern, not a patient-core field; do not introduce new patient-level blood-type attributes.
- Datatype rendering and validation metadata belong to backend-owned datatype definitions; frontend should consume metadata before using hardcoded fallbacks.
- Use deterministic, idempotent instantiation operations to materialize missing values from templates.
- Group/template applicability must be modeled via explicit context relation entities (N:M), not hardcoded `use_*` flags.
